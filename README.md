## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have API keys and configuration details from the following services:
* [Google AI Studio (for Gemini API)](https://aistudio.google.com/)
* [Firebase (for Auth & Firestore)](https://console.firebase.google.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/self_learner/mock-test-generator-app.git](https://github.com/self_learner/mock-test-generator-app.git)
    cd mock-test-generator-app
    ```

2.  **Create your configuration file:**
    In the main project folder (e.g., in a `js/` directory), create a `config.js` file. This file will store your secret keys. *This file is included in `.gitignore` and should NOT be committed to GitHub.*

3.  **Add your API keys to `config.js`:**
    ```javascript
    // config.js
    
    // 1. Firebase Configuration
    const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
      authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
      projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
      storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
      messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
      appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
    };
    
    // 2. Gemini API Key
    const GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY";
    ```

4.  **Link the config file:**
    Make sure your main `index.html` file imports your `config.js` file *before* your main `app.js` file:
    ```html
    <script src="js/config.js"></script>
    <script src="js/app.js"></script>
    ```

5.  **Run the application:**
    Since this is a static project (HTML, CSS, JS), you can simply open the `index.html` file in your browser. For the best experience (to avoid CORS issues with Firebase), it's recommended to use a simple local server.
    
    If you have VS Code, you can use the **"Live Server"** extension.

## Usage

1.  **Sign Up / Log In:** Create a new account or log in with your existing credentials.
2.  **Create Test:** Navigate to the "Create New Test" page.
3.  **Enter Details:** Fill in the topic (e.g., "JavaScript Array Methods"), the number of questions, and select the question types you want.
4.  **Generate:** Click the "Generate Test" button and let the AI build your quiz.
5.  **Take Test:** Once generated, you can start the test immediately.
6.  **Review Results:** After submitting, you'll see your score and the correct answers.
7.  **Dashboard:** Your new test is automatically saved to your dashboard for you to access or retake anytime.
